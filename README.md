# fm

The letters `fm` are short for the Chinese word _fangmao_ 仿冒, which literally means "to imitate and obscure", or "counterfeit." It is also a tool written in Go for generating spy implementations of interfaces.

Note: the use of the word "spy" is deliberate. See [here](https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2014/05/14/TheLittleMocker.html) for more.
